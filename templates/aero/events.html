<!--Event 1-->		<h3 class="major">Boomerang </h3>
									<p>A boomerang is a thrown tool, that is designed to spin about an axis perpendicular to the direction of its flight. A returning boomerang is designed to return to the thrower. It is well known as a weapon used by Indigenous Australians for hunting.</p><p>
This year's boomerang event consisted of a small lecture on the physics behind boomerangs and later a fun competition testing both endurance and accuracy of the boomerangs. The event saw enthusiasts ranging from the freshers up until the PhD students ideating, innovating, building and throwing boomerangs of all sizes and shapes.</p>

										<h3 class="major">RC Plane Competition</h3>
										<h5 style=" text-align: right">October-November 2019</h5>
										<p>The RC Plane competition is the premier technical event of the year, which is known for its enormity and the unparalleled technical input that goes into it. It lasts about 1.5 months in which students (mostly teams of 4) make a Remote Controlled Plane of their choice from scratch: Designing, mechanical part, electronics and the final build. After this, the teams battle it out by actually flying the planes on the competition days. During the whole process, they learn the nitty gritties of basic aviation and aeromodelling.</p>

<p>This event serves the primary motivation behind The Aeromodelling Club IIT Bombay, which is 'To inrease the number of Aeromodellers and Flyers in the institute'.
</p><p>
The event this year was a major hit among the students with over 100 teams (i.e. over 4000 students) participating successfully.</p>
